A particle-theme template as a landing page for my information page.

# Particle Feature

The particle feature was obtained with the help of this [particleground](https://github.com/jnicol/particleground). The changes in the particles such as speed, drift, colour, direction, density, etc. can be modified in `demo.js`.


# References and Inspiration

This template is a minimal form of the [Particle Jekyll Template](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle).
