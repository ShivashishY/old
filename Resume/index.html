                      I am 25 years old, a developer from the Historical capital of India, Varanasi. Programming is not just a career path for me, but also a hobby and a passion of mine. I have a <strong>BSc in Information Technology</strong> and a <strong>Masters in Computer Application</strong> I started coding sometime around 2011, which is when I started studying Computer Science in the Punjab Technical University. After getting my BSc, I studied MCA. I've worked with various technologies including<strong> Networking and Database</strong> in the past, but recently I've taken an interest in web development and web applications and programming. Ever since then, I've considered myself devoted to computer science.
